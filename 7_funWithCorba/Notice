Execution:

The easiest way is to use only one name service, running on the interbank server.

Running the interbank persistant server (also the unique name service ):
- Step 1: in a first terminal, start orbd on the port you want (> 1024)
	orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050

- Step 2: in a second terminal, launch the interbank persistant server using servertool
	servertool -ORBInitialPort 1050
	servertool > register -server InterbankServer -classpath .
	servertool > quit






Running a bank transiant server:
- Step 1: if you're not running it on the same machine, you will have to get the hostname of the interbank server, and the port used

- Step 2: launch the bank transiant server, and when prompted, enter the number of the bank
	java BankServer -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost interbankHost







Running a client: indicate the port and host of the bank server
- Step 1: if you're not running it on the same machine, you will have to get the hostname of the interbank server, and the port used
- Step 2: launch the client
	java Client -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost interbankHost
